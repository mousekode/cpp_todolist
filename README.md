# C++ To-do List
It is my first dedicated project.
## How it works?
There are 3 separate C++ file:
* **main.cpp**
* **input_processor.cpp**
* **rw_data.cpp**
**main.cpp** will be the controller, **input_processor** will process input given by the user,<br>
**rw_data** will be the bridge between **main.cpp** and **task_data.txt**.
>[!NOTE]
>I'm new in this, so discussion on how to improve it or<br>even contributions would help me in the long run.
